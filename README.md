# Writing an Interpreter in Go

This repository contains my journey of writing an interpreter in Go, based on the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of how interpreters work and improve my Go programming skills. 

## Refactoring with AI Assistance

Throughout this project, I will be utilizing an AI programming assistant to help me refactor and enhance the codebase. The AI assistant will provide suggestions and guidance to write cleaner and more efficient code. 

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my progress!
In addition to working through "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball, I will be using AI assistance to refactor the code in a more functional style. The AI assistant will provide suggestions and help me write cleaner and more efficient code. 

Please note that this README was generated by an AI. 

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my progress!
